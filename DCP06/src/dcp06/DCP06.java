       An XOR linked list is a more memory efficient doubly linked list. Instead of each node holding next 
        and prev fields, it holds a field named both, which is an XOR of the next node and the previous 
        node. Implement an XOR linked list; it has an add(element) which adds the element to the end, 
        and a get(index) which returns the node at index.
       
        If using a language that has no pointers (such as Python), you can assume you have access to 
        get_pointer and dereference_pointer functions that converts between nodes and memory addresses.
